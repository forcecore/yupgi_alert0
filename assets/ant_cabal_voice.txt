I did this, in batch.

You need Audacity, SoX.

Follow the video to make yourself familiar with the process.
Now to do the thing in batch:

1. Audacity, chain is what you want. But chain doesn't support multiple
   channels so we'll apply the effects channel by channel.
2. Chains --> Change Pitch --> -15%. --> Export Wav.
   Audacity creates "cleaned" folder at where the input are.
   That is "ch1".
3. Apply chain on ch1 to make ch2.
   Change Pitch --> -15% --> Phaser.
   Phaser params:
     * Stages: 24
     * Dry/Wet: 255
     * LFO Freq: 0.001
     * LFO Start Phase: 40
     * Depth: 40
     * Feedback: -70%
     * Output gain: 0
4. Apply chain on ch1 to make ch3.
   Change Pitch --> -20% --> Phaser.
   Phaser params:
     * Stages: 24
     * Dry/Wet: 255
     * LFO Freq: 0.001
     * LFO Start Phase: 0
     * Depth: 40
     * Feedback: -90%
     * Output gain: 0
5. Since Audacity can't handle mixing multiple channels, time for SoX to do
   the channel mixing.

import glob
import os

for fname in glob.glob("ch1/*.wav"):
    ch1 = fname
    ch2 = fname.replace("ch1", "ch2")
    ch3 = fname.replace("ch1", "ch3")
    out = fname.replace("ch1", "out")
    cmd = "sox -m {} {} {} {}".format(ch1, ch2, ch3, out)
    print(cmd)
    os.system(cmd)

Actually, above result was uncomprehensible.
Lich king thing applied instead.

1. ch1: -15% change pitch to orig
2. ch2: -20% change pitch to orig --> echo effect, delay 0.5, decay 0.6 -->
        fade out at the end.
3. copy ch1, reverse --> reverb
   * Room size 100
   * Pre delay 20
   * Reverbance 50
   * Damping 50
   * Tone low 80
   * Tone high 60
   * Wet gain 10
   * Dry gain 0
   * Stereo width 80
4. Channel gains: ch1 0 db ch2 -5db ch3 -10db

So what I can do is to automate as much as possible.
But do fading and merging, gains manually.

But I HATE manual work so I'd use SoX to do these gain and mixing, fading.

# Fade out the last 0.2 seconds.
    cmd = "sox {} {} fade 0 0 0.2".format(ch2, out)

# apply gain
    cmd = "sox {} {} gain -5".format(inf, ouf)

Ugh, fuck this. some files are missing.
Why dont I do it 100% SoX?
